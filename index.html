                            <p> Though proteins are essential to life, the process of discovering their function and structure is time consuming. 
                                Techniques such as x-ray crystallography and functional assays are resource-demanding and low-output compared to 
                                the high-throughput of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) techniques. Currently, there are several popular tools 
                                available, which align a novel protein sequence with known, annotated sequences. Sequence alignment is used in an 
                                attempt to extract information about the novel sequence's evolutionary (homologic) origin or function. Such tools, 
                                like BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool), use sequence alignment to determine homology and sequence similarity 
                                to annotated proteins within a database. As DNA sequence data continues to expeditiously grow, it would be highly beneficial 
                                to match the pace of protein function and structure identification with NGS. Using natural language processing techniques, 
                                I strove to determine if there is a potential for use of artificial intelligence in protein function classification away from 
                                the traditional techniques of homology and sequence alignment.</p>

                                The final production model had the following neural network architecture: an embedding layer, three convolutional layers for feature extraction,

                                two hidden layers of 160 & 80 nodes, respectively.

                            <p> Circa the culmination of this project, the world at large was in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and had suffered approximately 2.4 million COVID-related deaths.
                                 Hospitals, both rural and urban, all over the United States were undergoing extreme stress due to Covid-19 hospitalizations. 
                                 Thus, our team strove to identify a reliable and rapid way to identify Covid-19 pneumonia using anterior-posterior and posterior-anterior chest x-rays and 
                                 computer vision techniques. We focused our model on the classification of 3 classes of A-P/P-A chest radiography: Covid-19 pneumonia, viral pneumonia, and 
                                 normal presentation. Harnessing the convolutional neural network (CNN), an artificial intelligence algorithm, we produced a multi-class classification model 
                                 with high predictive power â scoring approximately 93.5% on both accuracy and recall.</p>

                            <p>The basis of learning and scientific discovery has always started with a question; posed by those with the curiosity to gravitate toward a deeper level of understanding.
                                 As a student, in the age of the internet, something as simple as the phrasing of a google search can determine if you find the correct resources to answer a query. 
                                 To the benefit of students and other curios individuals, Reddit is a main-stream forum where professionals and knowledgeable individuals gather to answer questions
                                  and discuss forum-related topics. In the field of natural sciences, there are quite a number of different branches of study and for new students or laypersons the

                    <p>Outside of data science and the natural sciences, I enjoy a smattering of unique, perhaps uncommonly associated, hobbies. 
                        Though my student-athlete glory days have passed, I continue to avidly enjoy weight lifting and running. 
                        When the sun is shining and there isnât too much of a chill in the air, I enjoy hiking - 
                        though my fantastically large dislike for insects always makes said relaxing, gorgeous stroll a little more chaotic than what might be considered the norm. </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">Aside from exercise-based interests, I am also an avid lover of storytelling and role-playing games. 
                        I believe stories are the catapult for human connection and understanding, as they let you walk in millions of othersâ shoes for a little while. 
                        If you canât find me in the gym, youâll find me face-first in a story, whether itâs a book, a video game,
                        or at the Dungeons & Dragons table with my friends where we are weaving a story all our own. </p>
