                            <p> Though proteins are essential to life, the process of discovering their function and structure is time consuming. 
                                Techniques such as x-ray crystallography and functional assays are resource-demanding and low-output compared to the high-output of new-age DNA sequencing techniques.
                                Currently, there are several popular tools available to align a novel protein sequence with known, annotated proteins in attempt to extract information about the novel sequence's origin or function. 
                                Such tools, such as BLAST, use sequence alignment to determine homology and sequence similarity to these known proteins. 
                                As DNA sequence data continues to expeditiously grow, it would be highly beneficial to match pace of protein function and structure identification with sequencing. 
                                Using natural language processing techniques, I strove to determine if there was a potential for use of artificial intelligence in rapid protein function identification away from homology or sequence alignment.</p>

                                The final product model had the following neural network architecture: an embedding layer, two convolutional layers for feature extraction,

                                The final model scored approximately 90.9% on balanced accuracy score and 94.4% on f1-score.

                            <p> At the time this project was created, the world at large was in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic. 
                                At project release, hospitals, both rural and urban, all over the United States were undergoing extreme stress due to Covid-19 hospitalizations. 
                                Our team strove to identify a reliable and rapid way to identify Covid-19 pneumonia, using anterior-posterior and posterior-anterior chest x-rays and artificial intelligence techniques. 
                                We focused on the classification of 3 classes of A-P/P-A chest radiography: Covid-19 pneumonia, viral pneumonia, and normal presentation. Harnessing the convolutional neural network (CNN), 
                                an artificial intelligence algorithm, we produced a multi-class classification model with high predictive power – scoring approximately 93.5% on both accuracy and recall. </p>

                                In the field of natural sciences, there are quite a number of different branches of study and for new students or laypersons the specific topics studied by each branch can be a mystery. </p>

                    <p>Outside of data science and the natural sciences, I enjoy a smattering of unique, perhaps uncommonly associated, hobbies. 
                        Though my student-athlete glory days have passed, I continue to avidly enjoy weight lifting and running. 
                        When the sun is shining and there isn’t to much of a chill in the air, I enjoy hiking - 
                        though my fantastically large dislike for insects always makes said relaxing, gorgeous hobby a little more chaotic than what might be considered the norm. </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">Aside from exercise-based interests, I am also an avid lover of storytelling and role-playing games. 
                        I believe stories are the catapult for human connection and understanding, as they let you walk in millions of others’ shoes for a little while. 
                        If you can’t find me in the gym, you’ll find me face-first in a story, whether it’s a book, a video game,
                        or at the Dungeons & Dragons table with my friends where we are weaving a story all our own. </p>
